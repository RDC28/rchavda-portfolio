    "description": "Built a web-based image compression tool using unsupervised learning to reduce image size while preserving visual quality.",
    "fullDescription": "This project implements an intelligent image compression system using MiniBatch K-Means clustering in LAB color space. It automatically selects optimal compression parameters using Shannon entropy and spatial variance, achieving 50–60% file size reduction without deep learning. The system is deployed as a Flask web app with real-time upload, compression, and download support.",

    "description": "Developed an end-to-end machine learning system to predict whether a restaurant dish will be successful, average, or unsuccessful.",
    "fullDescription": "This project models dish performance as a multi-class classification problem using Logistic Regression with a full preprocessing pipeline. It supports numeric and categorical features, custom dataset uploads, real-time model training, and probability-based predictions. The system is deployed as an interactive Flask web app with a clean UI and dataset validation logic.",
