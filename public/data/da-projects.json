        "fullDescription": "This was my first analytics dashboard, built in Excel using the Top 1000 movies dataset from IMDb. The data was cleaned using Power Query by handling missing values, correcting inconsistent entries, and creating custom columns for genre-level analysis. The dashboard is structured into three pages: a Home page highlighting top-rated movies across key metrics, a Genre page visualizing trends and comparisons across movie genres with slicers and timeline filters, and a Timeline page showing how major metrics evolved over the years. Pivot tables were used extensively in the backend to drive all visuals. The focus of this project was learning core dashboard fundamentals, data cleaning, and interactive filtering in Excel.",

Around 2000 rows of data were created with controlled parameters to ensure realistic and logical value ranges. The dashboard includes multiple pages: a landing page for navigation, Sales Overview for revenue-focused insights, Product & Category analysis to identify best-selling products and category trends, Customer & Regional Analysis for segment and city-level performance, and Operations & Logistics to analyze delivery times, returns, and internal efficiency. Each page uses its own slicers and timelines connected via report-level controls. This project strengthened my skills in Excel formulas, lookups, Power Query, dashboard navigation, and multi-page report design.",

The report includes pages for Channel Overview, Video Performance, Geographic Reach, and Top Videos Snapshot. While geographic data is partially synthetic due to API limitations, all other metrics are real-time. This project demonstrates API integration, parameterized data sources, and real-world analytics use cases, making it the most production-ready dashboard I’ve built so far.",
